# Sol - 17

Sol - 17 is a proof of concept ecommerce platform for the (fictitious) Sol - 17 clothing brand.
The goal for Sol - 17 was to make a functioning web application with React.js, using Firebase for data management. 

## Front - End (React.js)

React.js is the font-end, client-side rendering JavaScript library that controls manages interaction from the user in the browser. I chose it because I was learning React's, and making a full web application would force me to learn it's features through problem solving bugs.
React-Browser Router is used for all (URL) routing, along with React Context for state management across the application.

## Database (MongoDB)

Google's Firebase Firestore Database manages all storing of data and was chosen for its simplistic JSON-like document storing.
The goal with using Firebase was to get practice with requesting and storing data with a Document Objected database with React, as well as learning how to implement data fetching with React.
